# ExtraterrestrialEscape
My first game with C# and Unity

Extraterrestrial Escape is a game where the player controls a UFO in outerspace.
Objective of the game is to avoid obstacles/boundaries while controlling the UFO and reach the checkpoint which resembles a dart board.
Finishing a level/Reaching a checkpoint would take you to the next level which is significantly harder.

Controls:
1) W to move forward
2) S to move backward
3) A to rotate left
4) D to rotate right
5) SPACE bar to give the ufo thrusting force upwards
